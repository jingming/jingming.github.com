            Growing / Stabilizing the Team

          <div class="project-description">
            Currently, I'm running point on a project to scale our oncall rotations as the team plans to double in size for 2022, an initiative to deprecate one 
            of Twilio's last standing pieces of PHP code, an initiative to define SLOs for all of our systems, and growing engineers both within the Phone Numbers 
            organization and broader Twilio.
          </div>
          <div class="project-description">
            As the tenured engineer on the team, I now serve more of a consulting / overarching role. In general, this role involves me piloting programs with the 
            other Technical Leads in the Phone Numbers organization, helping out with incidents, providing guidance on upcoming road map items, giving context on 
            historical decisions, and helping onboard folks to any projects. I've built a light framework for all of our REST services so that various overhead is 
            naturally taken care of and engineers can focus on implementation. I've piloted our <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> initiative which 
            the team is adopting to stabilize our infrastructure and metrics.

            Regulatory Compliance

          <div class="project-description">
            Due to the <a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/09/phone-numbers-100-countries.html">international expansion</a> Twilio had done, we had to up-level 
            our Product offerings to comply with Global Phone Number <a href="https://www.twilio.com/guidelines/regulatory">Regulations</a>. First as part of a 6 person 
            tiger team, I was brought in to patch the existing system to allow for customers to submit Regulatory Documents so that they could come into compliance with 
            local regulations. 
          </div>
          <div class="project-description">
            After this was completed, I stayed on the team and was a lead engineer on the team that built a modernized  
            <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/phone-numbers/regulatory/getting-started">Regulatory</a> Product that launched December 2019 which allows all customers 
            to keep up with any local requirements. On top of Phone Numbers Regulatory concerns, this product now serves as the framework for the Twilio 
            <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/trust-hub">Trust Hub</a> Product.

            API Definitions
          </div>
          <div class="project-description">
            With the growing number of teams and products at Twilio, it became unsustainable to have the team write code for each API that Twilio introduced. 
            As a result, we extended the Helper Library Generation platform that was built into the API Proxy so that teams would be able to define the API 
            Proxy as well as the Helper Libraries. This platform now serves as the single point of truth for the entire Twilio API. Additionally, this project 
            served as a key instrument in our <a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/02/easily-make-api-calls-to-any-twilio-product-using-the-new-api-explorer.html">API Explorer</a>, 
            <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/runtime/functions">Functions</a>, and <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/api">Documentation</a> Products.

            Helper Library Generation
          </div>
          <div class="project-description">
            Twilio provides Helper Libraries in 6 languages (<a href="https://github.com/twilio/twilio-csharp">C#</a>, <a href="https://github.com/twilio/twilio-java">Java</a>, 
            <a href="https://github.com/twilio/twilio-node">node.js</a>, <a href="https://github.com/twilio/twilio-php">PHP</a>, 
            <a href="https://github.com/twilio/twilio-python">Python</a>, <a href="https://github.com/twilio/twilio-csharp">Ruby</a>) to simplify building on top of the API. 
            Since they are mostly wrappers around the API, the team started building a tool to auto-generate these libraries when a change was made in the API. 
            To start, I was in charge of building the Java and node.js libraries. After some organizational changes, I took over leadership of this project and drove it to 
            completion with all 6 libraries being generated through the tool. This brought down the time to update all the libraries from roughly 2 weeks of engineering time 
            (for one engineer) to 30 seconds on top of significantly reducing the number of bugs caused by removing humans from the flow.

            To provide a consistent experience across all of the APIs at Twilio, there exists a proxy layer that handles all incoming requests, authentication, and transforms any of the 
            data necessary before sending it to the appropriate product stack. I added all the integrations necessary to expose the <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/chat">Chat</a>,

            To further improve the <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel_Guide-g186338-London_England.html">Travel Guide</a> experience that had recently launched, 
            I led a project to introduce Just For You Guides to the TripAdvisor experience. On the TripAdvisor side, an interface was built for selected experts 
            in cities around the world to add recommendations based on a defined set of tags. On the customer side, a separate interface was built to select the 
            type of trip they were looking for based on the same set of tags. Once the user had submitted their request, they would receive a link to 
            their specially generated guide within 24 hours.

            In an effort to modernize the TripAdvisor Facebook Application, I helped build a various pages as part of a complete redesign. This included Travel Map page which 
            allowed a user to pin the places where they've visited and pages to summarize each city that the user had visited. Leveraging all the travel data for a user's friends, 
            we were also able improve the social experience by building pages to highlight all the places a user's friends had been. Parts of this effort still exist as part of
