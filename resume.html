            Growing + Stabilizing the Team
          </div>
          <div class="project-description">
            For my last role at Twilio, I was the Technical Lead for the Phone Numbers organization.
            In general, this role involved driving programs with the other Technical Leads in the
            organization, building frameworks, advocating for operational stability, helping with incidents,
            discussing upcoming initiatives, giving context on historical decisions, and mentoring younger
            engineers.
          </div>

          <div class="project-description">
            I built a light framework for Phone Numbers' REST services to standardize how service code is
            structured. The framework takes care of general metrics and error handling, allowing engineers
            more time to focus on implementation. I piloted our <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a>
            initiative which the team adopted to stabilize their infrastructure and metrics.
          </div>

          <div class="project-description">
            During the 2020 US Presidential Election cycle, Twilio had to prepare for a
            <a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/twilio-heightened-awareness-period-us-elections">significant increase</a>
            in Voice and SMS traffic. In the months leading up to election day, Twilio on-boarded millions of
            phone numbers to support  traffic. The influx of phone numbers caused one of the systems in the
            onboarding flow to fail. I patched and scaled our services, and re-triggered onboarding steps which
            allowed us to support the increased traffic without issues.
          </div>

          <div class="project-description">
            I led an initiative to clean up our database disk usage and request count. Working with our product
            management team, I audited our tables to determine the long-term need for our data. As a result,
            we moved required data to alternative storage, deleted from active databases, and set retention
            policies for some of our tables which brought our disk usage from 2TB down to 200GB. I also did
            an audit of the queries to the databases. Using this audit data, we purged unused tables and
            removed thousands of lines of dead code. Additionally, I found a set of queries running in a tight
            loop. I worked with an engineer from a feature team to patch this, reducing the number of
            queries to that database cluster by 70%.
          </div>

          <div class="project-description">
            For my last project at Twilio, I drove the splitting of the on-call rotation for the Phone Numbers
            organization into separate ones for each of the three teams within Phone Numbers. Throughout this
            project, I looked at each alert for the organization, determined if they were required, tagged
            them by the team, and migrated them into Terraform. I then reconfigured PagerDuty to route all
            alerts through the appropriate feature team's policies while leaving the underlying rotation
            unchanged. During the transition phase, I maintained a document that detailed every change that
            was made as well as any rollback steps, if needed.

            of Twilio's Phone Number catalog, we had to up-level our Product offerings to comply with
            Global Phone Number <a href="https://www.twilio.com/guidelines/regulatory">Regulations</a>.
            First, as part of a six-member tiger team, I was brought in to patch the existing system

            Product that launched in December 2019. The product allows all customers to keep up with

            In my first couple of years at Twilio the product portfolio grew substantially. Quickly, it became
            unsustainable for the team to write Python code for each API change. To support the increasing
            number of APIs, I led the team that extended the Helper Library Generation tool into the API Proxy.
            In this platform, when a product team built a new API, they would also define any proxy level
            transformations using JSON that the Proxy team used to write in Python. This platform now serves as
            the single point of truth for the Twilio API and is consumed by product teams to power the

            Generally speaking, these libraries are wrappers around the API. To streamline changes to these libraries,
            the team built a tool to auto-generate them for any change in the API. When I started on this project,
            I was implementing the Java and node.js libraries. Eventually, I took over leadership of this project
            and drove it to completion. Once completed, the tool allowed us to release updated client libraries more
            frequently, with fewer bugs, while using significantly less engineering time.

            When any API request comes into Twilio, a proxy layer tags the request with metadata, calls the authentication
            service, and transforms request data before sending the request to the specific product's stack. Once
            the product stack processes the API request, the proxy layer attaches response metadata and standardizes the
            response payload before completing the API request. I added all the integrations to expose the new
